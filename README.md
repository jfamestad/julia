Julia Set Generator

Julia generates a plottable data set of complex numbers and their "divergence score" under iteration.

This project can be built as a pure C standalone CLI utility or as a Python Module. When called from Python, we still use the C implementation for performance.

Build C CLI Utility
```make```  
<br>
Build and Install Python Module  
```sudo python setup.py install```
